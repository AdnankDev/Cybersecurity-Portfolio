## 📁 Welcome to My Cybersecurity Journey

This repository is a **collection of all my labs, projects, and hands-on activities** in cybersecurity.  
Each project reflects my growing skills in **network analysis, incident investigation, protocol behavior, and defensive techniques** — all built through self-study, labs, and real tool usage.

> “Knowing how systems break is the first step to securing them.”  

Here, you’ll find practical work using tools like:
- **Wireshark** – Packet analysis
- **Command Line** – Network troubleshooting
- **Simulated Attacks & Failures** – For learning defense

No theoretical fluff — just **real analysis, real tools, real reports**.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

| Folder | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `dns-failure-analysis/` | Investigated "destination port unreachable" using Wireshark and DNS simulation |
| `network-traffic-analysis/` | Analyzed TCP, UDP, ICMP traffic in different scenarios |
| `incident-reports/` | Formal reports on simulated security/network incidents |
| `wireshark-captures/` | `.pcapng` files from my labs |
| `learning-notes/` | Key concepts, commands, and takeaways |

📁 **Each lab includes:**
- A clear objective
- Step-by-step process
- Tools used
- Findings & conclusions
- Supporting evidence (screenshots, PCAP files, PDF reports)

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Practiced

- 🔍 **Wireshark** – Deep packet inspection
- 💻 **Command Line (Windows/Mac)** – `nslookup`, `netsh`, `ipconfig`, `dig`
- 📡 **TCP/IP Model** – Understanding DNS, ICMP, UDP, HTTP
- 🧪 **Network Troubleshooting** – Simulating outages and failures
- 📄 **Incident Reporting** – Writing clear, professional summaries
- 🧠 **Analytical Thinking** – Turning raw data into insights

## 📚 Learning Resources I Use
- TryHackMe / Hack The Box (Beginner Paths)
- Professor Messer (CompTIA Security+)
- Wireshark Official Docs
- Cyber Aces & Cybrary

## 📎 How to Use This Repo
1. Clone or download any lab folder
2. Open `.pcapng` files in **Wireshark**
3. Read the `report.pdf` or `README.md` to follow the analysis
4. Replicate the lab on your machine (safe & ethical!)

## 📝 License & Ethics
All labs are:
- Conducted in **safe, isolated environments**
- Using **non-existent domains/IPs** (e.g., `203.0.113.2`)
- For **educational purposes only**

No real systems were targeted.

MIT License applies to code and documentation unless otherwise noted.
